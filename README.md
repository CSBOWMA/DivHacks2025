## Inspiration
Financial fraud costs businesses billions annually, while many are left struggling with cash flow prediction and basic financial planning. We saw an opportunity to combine fraud detection, predictive analytics, and business intelligence into a single, intuitive platform. The vision was simple: _give businesses the foresight to prevent fraud before it happens and the insight to predict their financial future._

## What it does
Fraudsight.biz empowers businesses with three core capabilities:
**Fraud Detection:** Real-time transaction monitoring that identifies suspicious patterns and flags potential fraudulent activity before it impacts your bottom line.
**Business Analytics:** Interactive visualizations and dashboards that transform raw financial data into actionable insights, helping you understand your business performance at a glance.
**Balance Forecasting:** Predictive algorithms that analyze historical transaction data to forecast future account balances, enabling better cash flow management and strategic planning.

## How we built it
We built fraudsight.biz using a modern tech stack optimized for performance and scalability. The backend leverages **FastAPI** for high-performance API endpoints, **PostgreSQL** for robust data storage, and **Python** for our fraud detection algorithms and forecasting models. For the frontend, we created interactive data visualizations using **Chart.js** and **D3.js**, ensuring that complex financial data is presented in an intuitive, digestible format.
The fraud detection system analyzes transaction patterns using statistical anomaly detection, while our forecasting engine employs time-series analysis to predict future balances based on historical trends and seasonality.

## What's next for fraudsight.biz
**Enhanced Machine Learning Models:** We plan to implement more sophisticated machine learning algorithms for fraud detection, including neural networks that can identify complex fraud patterns that traditional statistical methods might miss. We'll also refine our forecasting models to incorporate external factors like seasonality, market trends, and economic indicators.
**Real-time Alerts and Notifications:** Integrate a comprehensive alert system that notifies users immediately when suspicious transactions are detected or when predicted balances fall below critical thresholds. This includes email, SMS, and push notifications with customizable alert rules.
